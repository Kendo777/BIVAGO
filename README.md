## Meta-search engine and e-commerce: Buy “anything” from a web.

The objective of this work is to build a PHP-based e-commerce platform supported by other PHP-based e-commerce platforms (Individual Assignment II). The platform will allow users to buy different types of products with different properties from a common interface (as amazon does). It will be done in groups of 2 or 3 and the meta-search engine will combine the individual assignments (from the members of the group) under a common search and ecommerce facility. As an example, you may think about the different shops inside amazon or the shopping search functionality from google.

The general idea for this last project is to create a fully interactive webapplication that will get the data required through AJAX requests to the MSE
server part (that will gather the data from other sources using HTTP requests),
loading and inserting it without fully reloading the page
